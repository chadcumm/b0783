# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **deployment target repository** (environment B0783) for the Cerner Clinical Office monorepo. It contains production-ready build artifacts deployed from source Angular project repositories — not source code.

Deployed builds are copied here by `scripts/deploy.js` in source projects (e.g., `npm run build:b0783`). The deployment script handles git pull, add, commit, and push automatically.

## Current Deployments

- **cov-orders-vulcan-test** — Orders Vulcan API Test MPage application

## Structure

```

```

## Key Details

- **Do not edit deployed files directly** — changes will be overwritten on next deployment from the source repo
- `config.json` in each project defines Clinical Office proxy endpoints (`contextRoot`, `domain`)
- `README.md` is auto-generated by the deployment script and tracks deployment history (version, branch, timestamp)
- New project directories appear when a source project first deploys to this environment
